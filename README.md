# Speech To Text Converter

Speech to Text is a web application built with React that allows users to transcribe their speech into text in real-time using the Web Speech API.
 The app uses two npm packages, react-speech-recognition and react-use-clipboard, to enable its basic functionality. react-speech-recognition is used to capture the user's voice and convert it into text, while react-use-clipboard is used to allow users to copy the transcribed text to their clipboard.
 
  The app has a simple and responsive user interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices. It is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to transcribe their speech, such as journalists, content creators, students, and professionals.
